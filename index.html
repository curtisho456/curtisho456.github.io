    <h3>Uncle Boy's Landscaping (Irene Hyo-Jung Song / Curtis Ho, 2018-???)</h3>

      <li><a href="https://geocities.ws/ubl/" title="Uncle Boy's Landscaping website" target="_blank"><strong>https://geocities.ws/ubl</strong></a> (opens in new tab)</li>
      <li>Uncle Boy's Landscaping (UBL) is the collaborative practice of Irene Hyo-Jung Song and Curtis Ho.
      </li>
      <li>UBL is primarily concerned with the wide-ranging implications of landscap(e/ing) - as colonial, masculine, imbricated with systems of power. UBL has also become a vessel for thinking on karaoke, gendered rituals and games, and early political identity formation, particularly in the contexts of East Asia and its diasporas. Their research-guided practice has typically taken form as installations incorporating video, sculpture, writing and publishing, inviting collaboration and social participation.
